# linux_config
Nothing fancy, just my "setup a newly installed ubuntu"-scripts.

It installs and configure Regolith with Polybar, fonts, themes and my standard setup of programs.

## run.
The will be some errors. Things change, I update the scripts to reflect my local changes and test them when i perform my next install...
```
> Install Xubtunu 19.10
> ./install_base_packages
> ./apply_my_config

> Perform manual steps...
```
