# linux_config
Nothing fancy, just my "setup a newly installed ubuntu"-scripts.

It installs and configures bspwm with Polybar, fonts, themes and my standard setup of programs.

Currently work in progress, I'm transfering to bspwm from regolith/i3.


## run.
There will be some errors. Things change, I update the scripts to reflect my local changes and test them when I perform my next install...
```
> Install Xubtunu 21.10
> ./install_base_packages
> ./apply_my_config

```

## Manual steps.
- Install vivaldi, [download here](https://vivaldi.com/sv/download/).
- Setup custom keyboard layout.


## TODOs
- Restructure apply config script, make it more like a deploy script that can run multiple times.

- battery warning
- deep sleep on lid close
- fingerprint reader
- lock screen on lid close.
- encrypt home dir

- select rofi theme in apply script.

- notification deamon, dunst?
- clipboard manager, https://github.com/cdown/clipmenu ?
- Apply configs for thunar, vscode, intellij

- install highlighting (sudo apt-get install highlight), make it work with ranger preview, and solarized.
